The crash in the cryptocurrency market in early 2018 was a hard lesson, and led me to transform the way I manage any assets. Much of my success has come from investing early in small market cap projects that I sold at up to 3,500% ROI. I specialize in DeFi and crypto infrastructure/architecture projects like Layer 1s, but have since expanded into all sectors, including NFTs and virtual land. Trading is only a surface-level decision and I think it is imperative when investing to have a comprehensive understanding of each project you are interested in and the principles involved in the market and industry as a whole. I offer consulting on the following topics:
        - Blockchain Fundamental Parts and Processes
        - History of Fiat, Blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum
        - Exploring All Sectors of Cryptos and DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
        - Using Centralized Exchanges",

I've always had a passion for gaming and technology, so it was a natural fit for me to pursue a career in this field. In my spare time, I enjoy playing chess, and I recently had the opportunity to play against Khalid, who shares my love for the TV series, Peaky Blinders. It was a thrilling match, and we both enjoyed testing our strategic skills on the chessboard. One of the aspects of game development that I find fascinating is the process of identifying and fixing bugs. It's like solving a puzzle, and I enjoy the challenge of finding the root cause of a problem and coming up with a solution. Overall, I love sharing my knowledge and experience with aspiring game developers, and I'm always looking for ways to help my students improve their skills and achieve their goals.",

However, I always had a strong passion for technology and wanted to explore it further. That's when I decided to enroll in the bootcamp and learn coding skills. The experience was truly transformative, and I'm now planning to pursue a CS degree in Italy to deepen my knowledge even further. In the meantime, I'm using the skills I learned at Le Wagon to freelance and work on exciting projects. When I'm not coding, I also teach photography, which is another passion of mine. I love helping others capture beautiful moments and memories through the lens. I'm excited about what the future holds and can't wait to see where this journey takes me!",
